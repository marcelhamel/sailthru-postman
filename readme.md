This Postman collection is designed to demonstrate some of the more common API requests made to Sailthru. Due to the nature of how these API's are built, each request (POST, GET, multi-part form uploads) will be structured differently within Postman. Please see the instructions below on how to import this collection and how to test with each request type.

- For implementations of Sailthru API's, it is highly recommended that users leverage one of Sailthru's [client libraries](https://getstarted.sailthru.com/developers/api-client/libraries-overview/).
- If you are a Sailthru user, most of these requests can be tested with the [API Test Tool](https://my.sailthru.com/api/test) within the Sailthru UI.
- For more information on JSON payloads for each endpoint, check out the [Sailthru API Documentation](https://getstarted.sailthru.com/developers/api-basics/introduction/).
